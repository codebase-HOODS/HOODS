# HOODS


-All development should happen in "dev" branch  and later should be pushed to master branch.

- ## Naming Conventions

 1. A method/function should always start with a small letter.
  	```javscript
  	// bad example
	function MyFunction() {...}

	// good example
	function myFunction() {...}
	```
