# HOODS


-All development should happen in "dev" branch  and later should be pushed to master branch.

- ## Naming Conventions

     1. A method/function should always start with a small letter.

        ```javascript
        // bad example
        function MyFunction() {...}

        // good example
        function myFunction() {...}
        ```

     2. for Variables follow the camel case convention, typing the words in lower-case, only capitalizing the first letter in each word. Incase of only one word write it in small

      
        ```javascript
        // good example
        var DeliveryNote = 1;

        // bad example
        var delivery_note = 1;
        ```
     3. for function with multiple words should always use an underscore between words.

          ```javascript
        
        // Good example functions/methods = camelCase
        my_function();
        calculate_area();

        // Bad example functions/methods
        MyFunction();
        CalculateArea();  
        ```
